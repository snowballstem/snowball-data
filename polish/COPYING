voc.txt was built as a random subset from https://sjp.pl/slownik/growy/sjp-20211130.zip that is licensed under GPL 2 and CC BY 4.0

output.txt was generated from voc.txt by running it through the stemmer, compiled into Python:

./Snowball polish.sbl -o polishstemmer -python # compilation


# Python code

from polishstemmer import Polishstemmer
stem = Polishstemmer() 
voc_path = 'polish/voc.txt'
voc = []
with open(voc_path, 'r') as f:
    for line in f.readlines():
        voc.append(line.strip())

output = stem.stemWords(voc)
out_path = 'polish/output.txt'
with open(out_path, 'w') as f:
    for word in output:
        f.write(str(word) + '\n')
